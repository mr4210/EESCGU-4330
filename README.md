Intro to Terrestrial Paeloclimate Project
Title: 

A Computational Model to Visualize the Effects of Added Influx of Fresh Melt-Water from the Greenland Ice Sheet on the North Atlantic Ocean Waters; 
Visualizing The Consequences of Dramatic Changes Recorded in Greenland's Paelorecords and Modeling Their Potential Climate Changes 

Intro:

In this project, I will attempt to build a simple computational model that aims to visualize a couple of climatic variables. Firstly, I will calculate the differential between the Greenland Sheet's newly forming ice versus the yearly mass loss due to melting. For this, I will use a loop styled function that will calculate the net ice loss over time. Secondly, I will use the results of the first model to inform a second model that takes into account the amount of surplus fresh waters added to the salty North Atlantic waters in order to visualize the potential changes to the ocean composition over time.
